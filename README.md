# Lifepo4-Battery-Banks
DIY battery bank validated at 99% capacity (397Ah/10.5h @440W avg, 1880W peak). 39-day monitoring reveals "architectural immunity" - mixed-brand cells achieve monolithic behavior via parallel topology. Key findings: k=1.003 Peukert, 12-day voltage stasis (σ=0.0038V), 34yr storage viability (9mA parasitic). Replication protocol + raw data included.
